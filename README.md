# Space Cakes
We created a repository to collect IEEE training solutions as a Space Cakes team from Eastern Mediterranean University. You may send your own questions and solutions or if you have better idea for a question which we solved, you can contribute us.

IEEE 24 Hours Programming Competition Training 

You can write your code in any programming language you want.

## Rules

* When you start solving a new question you must create a folder under its according level.
* Folders must have a describing name about the question (or the name of the question itself).
* Don't create multiple folders for a single question, just merge them under the same folder.
* Please don't forget to include the question's description into README file.
* Include your performance tests if possible.
